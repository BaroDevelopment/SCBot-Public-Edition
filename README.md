# SCBOT KOTLIN
##### PUBLIC EDITION
___

SCBot - that stands for Steam Controller Bot - is the custom made discord bot noticeably used in a popular subreddit server. Because other popular bots were not fit such a huge server's needs this one was created althought it initially served another purpose. 

Previously - and still - available and used in its Python version, this bot includes many features that provide peace and tranquility for any staff member of any big server. 

The Kotlin edition of it was developed due to the [announced death of Discord.py](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1) which was the previously used API wrapper. This edition is powered by [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [JDA-KTX](https://github.com/MinnDevelopment/jda-ktx) that together make development more manageable.

The **Public Edition** has content filtered out; most of it is due to the original source code containining comments with user ids, guild ids and their respective names (privacy concerns). Unfinished and abandoned ideas written in comments were also removed for the sake of cleanliness.
